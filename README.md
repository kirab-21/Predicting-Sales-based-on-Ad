# Predicting Sales based on Ads

By analyzing sales in relation to marketing ads, businesses can assess the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. They can determine which mode of ads generated the most sales, which channels or platforms were most successful, and which messages or creative elements resonated with the target audience.

The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered predictive model that accurately estimates sales based on the amount of money spent on various marketing platforms, and give businesses ideas, where to maximize thier ads campaign.
